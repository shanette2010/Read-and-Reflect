### Read-and-Reflect
**<p> From reading about Javascript and Java. And being in this class.
I have learned a significant amount. I wouldnt say im the greatest, but I will continue to learn and grow from this.
With this experiance it has taught me there is always something new to learn, something new to try, and something new to experiance.
Here are a few things I have read and woud like to get more familar with on my free time!** </p>

1. Java

    * Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than JavaScript programming.
    




2. JavaScript

     * JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as HyperTalk and dBASE. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.
     * The source text of JavaScript script gets scanned from left to right, and is converted into a sequence of input elements which are tokens, control characters, line terminators, comments, or whitespace.
     * There are three kinds of variable declarations.
   
           - Var- Declares a variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
       
           - Let- Declares a block-scoped, local variable, optionally initializing it to a value.
       
           - Const- Declares a block-scoped, read-only named constant.
